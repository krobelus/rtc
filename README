To build rtc run "make".

Basic usage:

    ./rtc formula.cnf [preprocessed] [proof]

The formula minus the eliminated clauses is written back into preprocessed.  The
list of the eliminated clauses is written to the file specified by proof.

Configuration is done in config.mk, or in config.def.mk if the former does not exist.

Notes for config option PARALLEL:

For cilk support, you need a working installation of cilk in ./cilkplus/.
Additionally for compilation and execution this is required:

    source cilk.sh

If PARALLEL is set to either CILK or LACE, THREADS will be set to $(nproc)
